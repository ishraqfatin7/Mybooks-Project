# My Books
## A place for your loves :3



I have created this site to demonstrated MERN development. I learned MERN about a year back and I do Personal projectes in every semester break.  

I wanted to try out Tailwind CSS. So I learned it for the first couple of days And made my concept into a project. It has so much to improve but in this short break, This is all I could do.I had only 7 days :( 

I will add the public link soon. For now, Here is the Video Demo of the site:
